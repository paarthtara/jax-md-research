# JAX MD Project

Contains code and notes for work on the JAX MD library. Current objectives include implementing:
- Simple 2D/3D particle attraction simulation
- Janus particles aggregation simulation (for fun)
- Patchy particles in 3D

## File Structure

- `crystallization-nvt.ipynb`: Basic code for LJ crystallization under NVT dynamics (Nose-Hoover)
